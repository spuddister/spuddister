# Welcome to my profile! 

My name is Sam Puddister and I am a IT Analyst with a Bachelors of Aerospace Engineering. My goal is to make a career switch into web development and become an expert in the field. 

I’m currently working my way through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to become a full stack developer. 

Take a look at some of my projects to get an idea of what I am proficient with.
