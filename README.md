# Welcome to my profile! 

My name is Sam Puddister and I am an aerospace engineering graduate living in Ottawa and my goal is to make a career switch into development.

I’m currently working my way through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to become a full stack developer. 

Right now I'm learning React. Take a look at my most recent project [here](https://github.com/spuddister/cv-project).
