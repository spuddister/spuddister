# My name is Sam Puddister 🐱‍🚀

I am an aerospace engineering graduate living in Ottawa whose goal is to make a career switch into development.

I’m currently working my way through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and I'm working hard to become a full stack developer. 

Right now I'm learning React. Take a look at my most recent project [here](https://github.com/spuddister/cv-project).
