# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam Puddister. 
Iâ€™m currently working my way through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and I'm working hard to become a full stack developer in the future. 
Iâ€™m currently making my way through the Javascript course after completing the foundation and the intermediate HTML and CSS courses.
